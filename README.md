# jpeg9e
Stock package of jpeg9e

NOTE: This file READme.md is my personal addition to the jpeg-9e package. It is intended to be a quick start and pointers to the important information to get started. It is not intendent to replace the README file from the source package. 

In short, this repository contains the is the original package from the Independent JPEG group as found on the internet (https://www.ijg.org) as the un-tar product of (jpegsrc.v9e.tar.gz).

1. If it is your first time with jpeg check the following documentation files:

User documentation (From the jpeg-9e/README file):
  install.txt		How to configure and install the IJG software.
  usage.txt 		Usage instructions for cjpeg, djpeg, jpegtran and more
  *.1			Unix-style man pages for programs (same info as usage.txt).
  wizard.txt		Advanced usage instructions for JPEG wizards only.
  cdaltui.txt		Description of alternate user interface for cjpeg/djpeg.
  change.log		Version-to-version change highlights.

Programmer and internal documentation:
  libjpeg.txt		How to use the JPEG library in your own programs.
  example.c		Sample code for calling the JPEG library.
  structure.txt		Overview of the JPEG library's internal structure.
  filelist.txt		Road map of IJG files.
  coderules.txt 	Coding style rules --- please read if you contribute code.

2. Install the jpeg software package - instructions (From jpeg-9e/install.txt):

% ./configure
% make
% make test

If that doesn't complain, do

% make -n install

3. use the software (From jpeg-9e/usage.txt)

Two programs are provided, cjpeg to compress an image file into JPEG format,
and djpeg to decompress a JPEG file back into a conventional image format.

On Unix-like systems, you say:

	cjpeg [switches] [imagefile] >jpegfile
or
	djpeg [switches] [jpegfile]  >imagefile

On most non-Unix systems, you say:

	cjpeg [switches] imagefile jpegfile
or
	djpeg [switches] jpegfile  imagefile

For more usage 

	cjpeg -help
and
	djpeg -help
  
For developers, once you have completed the installation (See steps 1. and 2. here), you can use the functionality of the package as a library. For this purpose, consult libjpeg.txt and example.c

Have fun.
